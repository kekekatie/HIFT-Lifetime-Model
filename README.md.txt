# HIFT-Engine: A Computational Laboratory for a Quasicrystalline Vacuum Model

This repository contains the code, data, and results for the HIFT-Engine, a computational pipeline designed to explore the Helical Information Field Theory (HIFT) hypothesis. The engine models a 3D quasicrystalline vacuum structure derived from a canonical projection of the 8D E8 lattice.

This work was developed by [Your Name or "HIFT Collaboration"] in September 2025.

## The Core Result

The engine's primary finding is the successful validation of a key theoretical prediction: the structure factor of the simulated vacuum exhibits Bragg peaks whose positions are governed by the **Golden Ratio, $\phi \approx 1.618$**.

This was confirmed by a "ground truth" experiment where the simulation's strongest measured peak was used to analytically predict the location of a secondary peak. The simulation's data showed a nearly perfect match with this prediction, providing strong evidence for the model's validity.

## Reproducibility

The primary result can be reproduced by running the main Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.

1.  **Environment:** Set up a Python environment using Anaconda. The necessary libraries are `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `pandas`.
2.  **Run Simulation:** Open and run the `HIFT-Engine-v2.1.ipynb` notebook. The script will perform the high-resolution simulation and generate all analysis and plots.
